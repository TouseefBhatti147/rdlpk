<br/>&nbsp;At “Royal Developers and Builders” (referred to as "Company," "us" or "we"), we recognize that your privacy is important. This Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Company's website www.rdlpk.com (the "Site"), as well as related products and services we may offer to you (collectively referred to as the "Services"). This Policy also covers how personal and other information that we receive or collect about you is treated. Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this Site.

<br/>
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by updating any privacy information on this page.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICES.

<h4>1. Types of Information We Collect</h4>
In order to better provide you with web-based software solutions, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information.
Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"):
This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Examples of PII may include your first and last name, company name, postal address, and email address. PII does not include any information which you provide regarding third parties, such as your customers, while using the Services.
When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account, for our services, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain PII.
Aggregate Information:
This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.

<h4>2. How We Collect and Use Information</h4>
We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain services available on the Site. These may include: (a) registering for an account on our Site; (b) submitting product orders through the Site; or (c) submitting an email to us.
We will primarily use your PII to provide best service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal service providing efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our service offerings, and customize our Site's content, layout, and services. We may use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we may use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy.
We do not use information which you provide about third parties, such as your customers, for any marketing or promotional purposes or share this information with others.
We may also collect certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information.
<h4>3. Cookies</h4>
Depending on how you use our Site, we may store cookies on your computer in order to collect certain aggregate data about our users and to customize certain aspects of your specific user experience. A cookie is a small data text file which is stored on your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more personalized information, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you back to our Site. We may use cookies to perform tasks such as: monitoring aggregate site usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords (if you allow us to do so), storing account and advertising preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we make available to you. However, we do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Site may not function properly if you elect to disable cookies
<h4>4. Release of Information</h4>
We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others.
Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide PII to the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our products or services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.
<h4>5. Third Party Privacy</h4>
We do provide some of our product and service offerings through third party services provided by affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties ("Service Partners"). We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong privacy policies. However, the use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed the respective privacy policies of those providers and is not subject to our control. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other Sites accessible through this Site, including our Advertising and Service Partners, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each Site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
<h4>6. Updating and Correcting Information</h4>
We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us. You may change any of your PII in your account online at any time by logging into your account. You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by emailing us at sales@rdlpk.com

We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, some information, such as past trends, logs of technical support calls, or other information may not be deleted. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.
<h4>7. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h4>
We may, from time to time, send you email regarding new services that we feel may interest you. Only Company (or agents working on behalf of Company and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these notifications, and only if you have previously indicated that you wish to receive them. If you do not want to receive notifications from us, you can "opt-out" by accessing your account online editing your account information to no longer receive such notifications.

By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Site may not work properly in your case.


<h4>8. Security of Your PII</h4>
At our Site you can be assured that your PII is secure as we strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your PII. For example:
We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete and current. We use PII only for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and agents who have a reasonable need to come into contact with your information. For example, we may provide members of our technical support team with limited access to your account in order to allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site.
Additionally, we also employ a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect PII. Our secure servers and our data centers are protected by encryption, and our servers reside behind firewalls and password protection.
Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.
